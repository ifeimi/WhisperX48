This script relies on [whisperx](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX), which provides an improvement to [OpenAI's whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) with more accurate and especially word-level timestamps. This is achieved by forcing align the inaccurate timestamps generated by whisper with some speech model ([wav2vec2.0](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self) for example). \
