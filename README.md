Right now I'm adding python usage of some other whisper-based tools, whisperX and stable-whisper for example, in order to generate more accurate timestamps.  
\
Split sentence when it is too long (which is already kind of solved by stable-whisper).  
\
I modify this project strongly according to my demands. But feel free to submit issues or directly contact me if you have any suggestions. I also strongly recommend you to contribute to the "original" [N46Whisper](https://github.com/Ayanaminn/N46Whisper) project as well.

This script relies on [whisperx](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX), which provides an improvement to [OpenAI's whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) with more accurate and especially word-level timestamps. This is achieved by forcing align the inaccurate timestamps generated by whisper with some speech model ([wav2vec2.0](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self) for example). \
